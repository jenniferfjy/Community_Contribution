# Machine Learning Cheat Sheet
Machine learning is becoming more and more popular these days, and the most popular languages for training machine learning models are R and Python (both have extensive packages and resources). For this community contribution, I build a cheat sheet for doing data preprocessing, machine learning, and simple data visualization in both R and Python. The structure of the cheatsheet is as follows:

1. Data processing (import file, scaling, train test split) 
2. Supervised learning techniques (regression models, classification models)
3. Unsupervised learning techniques (PCA, K-Means)
4. Evaluating model performance (RMSE, R2, accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, F1-score)
5. Preliminary data visualization (ggplot2, seaborn)

This project helps me to gain a better understanding of different packages in R and Python and know how to implement them accordingly. There are tons of recourse out there, and my cheat sheet is just a simple snapshot. I plan to add more useful functions to this cheat sheet in the future.
